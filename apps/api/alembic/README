Generic single-database configuration for Alembic.

## Usage

### Create a new migration

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add new column"
```

### Apply migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback one migration

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### See migration history

```bash
alembic history
```

### See current version

```bash
alembic current
```

## Best Practices

1. Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations in development before production
3. Backup database before running migrations in production
4. Never edit applied migrations - create new ones instead
